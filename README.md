# Hand-Tracking-Mouse

The Hand-Tracking-Mouse project is an innovative open-source initiative designed to offer an alternative way to control the computer mouse for individuals facing challenges with traditional mouse devices due to physical impairments or disabilities. Utilizing advanced hand tracking technology, this project enables users to navigate and interact with their computer using simple hand movements.

## Overview

This project leverages the power of OpenCV and MediaPipe for precise hand detection and tracking, alongside PyAutoGUI for seamless mouse cursor control. It's a testament to how technology can be used to make computing accessible to everyone.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/xn-coder/Hand-Tracking-Mouse.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Hand-Tracking-Mouse
3. Install the required libraries using pip:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

To start using the hand tracking mouse, run the following command in your terminal:
python hand_tracking_mouse.py
Once the program is running, it will use your computer's webcam to detect and track your hand movements. Move your hand to control the mouse cursor. To simulate a mouse click, make a fist with your hand.

Press the 'q' key at any time to exit the program.

## Libraries Used

- **OpenCV**: For image processing and hand detection.
- **MediaPipe**: For robust hand tracking.
- **PyAutoGUI**: For controlling the mouse cursor.
